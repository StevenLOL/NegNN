# NegNN (Neural Network for Automatic Negation Detection)

The code implements a feed-forward NN (*/feed_forward*) and a BiLSTM(*/bilstm*) to perform automatic negation scope detection. 

# Data
Training, test and development data can be found in the */data* folder.
For training, development and initial testing, we used the data released for the [*SEM2012 shared task](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/sem2012-st-neg/); please refer to the shared task and related papers for information regarding the annotation style.
Additional test data extracted from Simple Wikipedia is available in */data/test/simple_wiki*. The data was manually annotated following the guidelines released during the *SEM2012 shared task. Please refer to the .pdf file for ulterior information.
